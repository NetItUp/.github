# Introduction

Net It Up was founded in 2013 by Adriano Giacomini with the goal of becoming a benchmark in the field of IT Management.
From a small startup, we quickly climbed the ranks to become a leader in the business IT solutions sector.

Over the years, we have specialized in Odoo ERP, offering tailored implementations, custom module development, and seamless integrations that empower companies to optimize their processes and scale efficiently.

Through a journey of innovation and cybersecurity, we have solidified our position as a trusted reference point not only in Udine, but also beyond local borders.
